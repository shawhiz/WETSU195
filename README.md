# WETSU195
Project built for a class to simulate a scheduling app. 
Here's a few key features and points:
-language switching based on locale 
-timezone handling taking in dates/times in user localtime, saving utc, then displaying back in local
-CRUD of clients and appointments
-Reports in TreeViews
-all data is in a remote DB that may not be accessible in the future because this was for coursework.

This project was a lot of fun. Feel free to install the exe to see it in action. username and password are 'test'
